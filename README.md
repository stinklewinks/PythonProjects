# PythonProjects
This is a repo for my Python projects for CS

Scripts currently included:

- main.py
- lifeinweeks.py
- oddoreven.py
- bmi.py
- leapyear.py
- paythebill.py
- pizza.py
- rockpaperscissors.py
- rollercoaster.py

Each of these scripts will be updated with more functionality as I learn more.

Thanks for reading.

### PS

I am looking to add more complex projects in the future. So keep your eyes peeled on this repo
as the hierarchy changes and folders get added!
